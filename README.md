# spark-ms-clustering

# Introduction

The spark-ms-clustering  application is the [Spark Algorithm](https://spark.apache.org/) of the newly developed _mass spectra clustering_ algorithm. It is used to cluster massive amount
of mass spectrometry data in public resources such as the [PRIDE](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride) repository for MS/MS based proteomics data.

The spark-ms-clustering application relies on the [spectra-cluster](https://github.com/spectra-cluster/spectra-cluster) clustering API. All implementations of relevant clustering algorithms
can be found there.

The following descriptions are only based on the clustering pipeline used to create the [PRIDE Cluster](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/cluster) resource.
