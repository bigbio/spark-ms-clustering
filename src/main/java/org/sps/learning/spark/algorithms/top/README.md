Top 10 elements
===============
The purpose of this algorithm is to find top-10 (or bottom-10)
for a given set of (key, value) pairs.

This package (org.dataalgorithms.chap03.sparkwithlambda) contains source code
for chapter 03 of the Data Algorithms book published by O'Reilly.

Top10.java assumes that all K's are unique for all given inputs of (K,V).
This is optimal solution when all K's are unique.'

Top10NonUnique.java assumes that all K's are non-unique for all given
inputs of (K,V).  This is a general solution, which finds top-N for
all unique and non-unique keys.
